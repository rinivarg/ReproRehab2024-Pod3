Below are some resources on how to get started on Git and GItHub to effectively use this repository:

1) [Git for Humans](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans)! by Alice Bartlett. This is Rini's absolute favorite slide deck meant to give you an intuitive understanding of what Git does and Git-related lingo. This introduction to the logical structure and function of Git will help you identify potential uses in your research work. 
	* Here's the slide deck Rini presented on [Intro to Git](https://github.com/rinivarg/ReproRehab2024-Pod3/blob/main/Git%20and%20GitHub/Intro_to_Git.pdf)

2) [Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git): If #1 made you curious and you want to explore more, the website linked will take you through Git installation. You will need this for #4.

3) GitHub: GitHub is the user-friendly platform that uses the Git software to do all the things you can do with Git but in a less overwhelming way! (think R studio for R... similar concept). GitHub can be used as a desktop application or directly off the website.

4) Using Git within R Studio: (thanks to our Guru Andrew!) Here's a step-by-step guide to [integrating Git and R Studio](https://github.com/rinivarg/ReproRehab2024-Pod3/blob/main/Materials/Bonus/Github%20integration%20in%20Rstudio%20-%20How%20to%20download%20the%20repo%20into%20Rstudio%20and%20keep%20it%20updated%20on%20your%20local%20machine..pdf) and a very useful [website](https://happygitwithr.com/fork-and-clone#fork-configure-upstream) to troubleshoot and for a look under the hood on how this works.
